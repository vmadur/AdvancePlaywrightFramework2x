Reply with JSON only:
{"candidates":[{"selector":"...","strategy":"css|testid|role|text|label|placeholder","reasoning":"..."}]}

Rules:
- Every selector must target an element present in the markup above. Do not invent attributes.
- Order candidates best first. Prefer stable attributes (data-test, id, name) over text or position.
- Use Playwright selector syntax. For role, write it as: role=button[name="Login"]
- Give 2 to 4 candidates so a human has a real choice, not one guess.
