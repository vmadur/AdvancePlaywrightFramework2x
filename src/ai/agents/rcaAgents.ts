/**
 * RCA agent — explains why a test failed and how badly it matters.
 *
 * The reporter calls analyzeFailure() for each failed test and renders the
 * result in the AI Verdict tab: severity and priority as badges, the root
 * cause as prose, the fixes as a list. That shape predates this agent, so the
 * schema below matches it exactly rather than inventing a new one.
 *
 * Severity and priority live here rather than in a separate triage agent: one
 * call is cheaper, and it keeps the two consistent with the explanation that
 * justified them.

Reply with JSON only:
{"severity":"critical|high|medium|low","priority":"P0|P1|P2|P3",
"rootCause":"why this failed, naming the specific assertion or call",
"fixes":["concrete step","concrete step"]}

Guidance:
- rootCause names the actual assertion or call that broke, not a generic category.
- severity reflects user impact if this were real; priority reflects fix urgency.
- A wrong assertion in the test is usually medium/P2; a broken product path is high or critical.
- fixes are concrete actions, not "investigate further".
