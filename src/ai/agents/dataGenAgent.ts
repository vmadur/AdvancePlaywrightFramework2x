Rules:
- checkin and checkout are YYYY-MM-DD, and checkout is strictly after checkin.
- totalprice is a whole number between 0 and 100000.
- firstname and lastname are 1 to 40 characters.
- additionalneeds is optional; include it on some rows and omit it on others.
- scenario names what the row exercises, e.g. "minimum price" or "long stay".
- Vary the rows. Do not return ${count} near-identical bookings.
