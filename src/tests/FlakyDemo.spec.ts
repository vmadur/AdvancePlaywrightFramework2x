 * Flakiness demo: 10 tests, 7 rock solid and 3 that pass on odd-numbered runs
 * and fail on even-numbered ones.
 *
 * Run it twice. The first run is all green, the second turns those 3 red, and
 * the reporter's build-to-build diff reports exactly those 3 as flaky, with an
 * AI summary of what they have in common.
 *
 *   npx ts-node -e "require('./src/tests/aiTest/demoState').resetDemoState()"
 *   AI_DEMO=1 npx playwright test --project=ai FlakyDemo   # run 1: 10 pass
 *   AI_DEMO=1 npx playwright test --project=ai FlakyDemo   # run 2: 7 pass, 3 fail
 *
 * Gated behind AI_DEMO because a test designed to fail must never turn the real
 * suite red.
