/**
 * Run counter for the flakiness demo.
 *
 * Real flakiness is non-deterministic, which makes it useless for a demo: you
 * cannot show a reliable "passes, then fails". This counts how many times each
 * test has run and lets a test fail on even-numbered runs, so run 1 is green,
 * run 2 is red, and the reporter's build-to-build diff has something real to
 * find.
 *
 * State lives beside the build snapshots the flaky analyzer already uses.
